Steps to implement NgRx:
1. Create actions file and add class for AddItem action which implements Action interface
2. Create a reducer which will be responsible for the state change
    A function that takes two arguments: state and Action
    In this, default state will be the initial state of the app
3. Add StoreModule in app.module and pass the reducer function to it
4. In our components/services inject the store dependency of type Store which takes a generic data
5. To initialize the data of our component with initial state
   use the select method on this store which returns an Observable
6. Use async pipe in template to subscribe and get the data automatically
7. To perform new actions like add/update/delete use the dispatch method on store
